# Intelligent-Agent-Based-Book-Purchasing-System
This project demonstrates how a GPT-powered agent can autonomously negotiate and complete a book purchase using the OpenAI Assistants API. The system models a “Client Agent” that interacts with simulated bookstores, requests proposals, compares prices, and confirms the purchase — similar to behaviors found in JADE multi-agent systems.
